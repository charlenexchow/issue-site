		<div class="topbodyL">
			Food waste is the loss of food at any point along the food supply chain, from production to processing to retail to consumption. Waste can occur for various reasons such as overproduction, spoilage, or consumer behaviors. This phenomena is a global issue with detrimental social, economical, and environmental impacts. There are many possible efforts to reduce food waste from an individual consumer level all the way to advocating for governmental changes.

		<div class="rowL">
			<ul class="impactlistL">
				<li>
					<div class="impactL">Greenhouse gas emissions:</div>
					Food waste generates greenhouse gas emissions when it decomposes in landfills, releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.
				</li>	
				<li>
					<div class="impactL">Wasted resources:</div>
					Producing and distributing food requires significant resources, including water, land, energy, and labor. When food is wasted, these resources are also wasted.
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="impactL">Water and land use:</div>
					Agriculture and food production consume large amounts of water and land. When food is wasted, these resources are used inefficiently, leading to water and land degradation and reduced biodiversity.
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="impactL">Use of chemicals and pesticides:</div>
					 Food production and agriculture often rely on the use of chemicals and pesticides, which can have negative environmental impacts. When food is wasted, the use of these chemicals and pesticides is also wasted.
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="impactL">Reduced soil fertility:</div>
					Food waste can reduce soil fertility by depleting nutrients and organic matter from the soil, leading to decreased productivity and increased erosion.
